# CardioVisionX: Explainable Deep Learning Model for ECG-Based Myocardial Infarction Detection
Once regarded as the reliable
 chronicle of a heartbeat, electrocardiograms all too frequently
 fail due to human error and inconsistent interpretation. In
 response, this work presents a daring vision: an ECG picture
 categorization framework that combines clinical rigor with
 deep learning’s revolutionary ability, surpassing the limitations
 of convention. Its core is a redesigned DenseNet201 that has
 been transformed via dual dropout regularization, transfer
 learning, and judicious augmentation to provide previously
 unheard-of stability and robustness. The model achieves
 near-perfect accuracy (99.46%) while maintaining equilibrium
 across precision, recall, and F1-score after being trained on
 a carefully selected dataset of 928 ECG pictures from four
 important diagnostic classes. The use of Grad-CAM enhances
 interpretability in addition to numerical superiority, making the
 decision-making process transparent and clinically significant for
 practitioners. This method not only improves diagnosis accuracy
 but also signals a paradigm shift in cardiovascular medicine
 toward reliable, explicable, and high-stakes decision support by
 overcoming the drawbacks of manual feature extraction and
 traditional CNN paradigms.
